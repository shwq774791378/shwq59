This is the sort of planning document and outline for the Atom book. This
largely outlines how we're composing the book and what is still to be
done.  We'll remove lines from this when each section is completed so we
only have what it left to do here.

You'll notice in some of the active `book/[section]/sections/` folders
there are some `xx-name.asciidoc` files. These are sections of content that
should probably be folded in at some point but we're not sure exactly where
to put them. They aren't included in any of the main files, so they aren't
currently rendered. If you want to write something and aren't sure where it
goes, you can name the file in this manner until we figure out how to fold
it into the narrative structure.

Here is the remaining outline:
