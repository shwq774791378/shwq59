=== init.coffee

When Atom finishes loading, it will evaluate _init.coffee_ in your _~/.atom_ directory, giving you a chance to run arbitrary personal CoffeeScript code to make customizations. You have full access to Atom's API from code in this file. If customizations become extensive, consider creating a package, which we will cover in <<_creating_a_package>>.

You can open this file in an editor from the _Atom > Open Your Init Script_ menu.

For example, if you have the Audio Beep configuration setting enabled, you could add the following code to your _~/.atom/init.coffee_ file to have Atom greet you with an audio beep every time it loads:

[source,coffee]
----
atom.beep()
----

This file can also be named _init.js_ and contain JavaScript code.
